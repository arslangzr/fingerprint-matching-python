# Fingerprint Matching Project

This project demonstrates fingerprint matching using OpenCV's SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) and FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors) based matcher. The application compares a test fingerprint image with a set of fingerprint images stored in a database, identifying matches based on keypoint features.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Joblib

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
